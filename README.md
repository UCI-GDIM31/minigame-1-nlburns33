## Devlog
Components are the 'ingredients' that make up GameObjects, and GameObjects are the 'dishes' that make up the 'meal' that is a Scene. Multiple unique Components are used in a GameObject, much like how multiple unique ingredients are put together to make a single dish. Similarly, these GameObjects are put together as part of Scenes, much like how a meal is comprised of various dishes. In both of these systems more of the smaller items (such as Components/ingredients) can be added without necessarily requiring the larger items (such as Scenes/meals) to be redone, although doing may be upset the gameplay (or flavor/texture).
